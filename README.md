## Tips and Tools for using Devtools
A talkthrough workshop by [Jackie Ho](http://ohho-design.com/).

### How to open DevTools
- Click into objects or view overall page
- Highlighting to find the thing you want
- Docking / Settings

### Testing out styles
- Finding the right line
- What's being applied versus what's not (strikethroughs)
- Changing existing properties (colors)
- Adding new styles
- Differences between editing existing classes versus "element.style"
- Force state
- "Styles" vs "Computed"
- Finding the file

### Messing with HTML
- Text
- Duplicating

### Testing screen widths + throttle
- Device Mode (user agent string, viewport sizing, devicePixelRatio, text auto-sixing, mobile scroll bars, touch events (no hover), touch emulation)
- Custom pixel ratio (interesting for testing out breakpoints / media queries)
- Jump to the media query
- Network throttling (+ offline)
